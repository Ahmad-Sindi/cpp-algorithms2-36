# Algorithm Challenge #36 – Add Array Elements Semi-Dynamically
-
🧮 Problem Description
-
This program simulates a semi-dynamic array using a fixed-size array in C++.  
The user is asked to enter numbers one by one, and each number is stored sequentially
in the array. After each insertion, the user decides whether to continue adding
more elements or stop.

The maximum array size is 100 elements, and the program keeps track of the
logical array length using a reference variable.

💡 What You’ll Learn
---
- Simulating dynamic behavior using static arrays
- Passing arrays to functions in C++
- Using reference parameters to track array size
- Writing clean, modular, and reusable functions
- Strengthening algorithmic thinking with user-driven loops



🧩 Example
--
**Input:**
Please Enter a Number  
5  
Do you want to add more numbers? 1 = Yes, 0 = No  
1  
Please Enter a Number  
8  
Do you want to add more numbers? 1 = Yes, 0 = No  
0  

**Output:**
Array Length: 2  
Array Elements: 5 8  



📂 File Information
-
- **Language:** C++  
- **File Name:** add_array_elements.cpp  
- **Challenge Number:** #36  



💬 Notes
-
This challenge focuses on understanding how arrays work internally in C++  
and how to manage data manually without using STL containers like `vector`.

It’s an essential step before moving to fully dynamic data structures.
